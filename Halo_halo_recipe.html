            <ul>
                <li>You can customize your Halo-Halo by adding or removing ingredients based on your preferences. Some variations include adding sweetened pineapple, toasted rice flakes, or other tropical fruits.</li>
                <li>For a creamier treat, you can substitute some of the milk with coconut milk.</li>
