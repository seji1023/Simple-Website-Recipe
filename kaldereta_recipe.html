            <h3>Instructions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the beef and sear until browned on all sides. Remove from the pot and set aside.</li>
                <li>In the same pot, add onions and garlic. Sauté until soft and fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and bell peppers. Cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes soften.</li>
                <li>Return the beef to the pot and stir to combine with the vegetables.</li>
                <li>Pour in the tomato sauce, soy sauce, and beef broth. Stir and bring to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Season with salt, pepper, and bay leaf. Cover and let it cook for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender.</li>
                <li>Add the potatoes, carrots, peas, and raisins (if using). Continue to cook for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
                <li>Stir in liver spread and olives, and cook for another 5 minutes for a creamy consistency and added depth of flavor.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Serve hot with steamed rice.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Helpful Tips:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For a richer flavor, use beef stew meat or short ribs.</li>
                <li>If you don't have liver spread, you can substitute with pâté or leave it out for a lighter version.</li>
                <li>Kaldereta is often served with a side of steamed white rice, but you can also pair it with bread to soak up the sauce.</li>
                <li>For a spicier kick, you can add a few slices of chili or use chili flakes to taste.</li>
            </ul>
